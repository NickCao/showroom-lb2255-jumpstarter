= Development Workflow

This section outlines the comprehensive workflow for automotive software development, from initial project creation through testing and validation on target platforms.

[#project_creation]
== Project creation

Begin your development journey in the Red Hat Developer Hub portal:

- Browse and select an appropriate software template for your automotive application
- Provide necessary configuration parameters and initial setup information

The system automatically creates your project structure and provisions all supporting infrastructure through OpenShift GitOps.

NOTE: This is covered in xref:activity-01.adoc[Activity 1].

[#application_development]
== Application development

Utilize Red Hat DevSpaces as your integrated development environment:

- Write, edit, and refine your automotive software code in the browser-based IDE
- Run preliminary tests directly within the DevSpaces environmen

Validate basic functionality before proceeding to formal testing phases.

NOTE: This is covered in xref:activity-02.adoc[Activity 2].

[#application_testing]
== Application testing

Push your code to the designated source code repository (the hosted GitLab):

- Code commits automatically trigger the configured CI/CD build pipelines
- Successfully built artifacts (RPM packages, containers, OS images) are generated
- Leverage cloud infrastructure for comprehensive integration testing

This phase helps verify component interactions before advancing to virtual or HIL testing.

[#application_validation]
== Application validation

Start the formal process of application validation by creating a pull request (PR):

- Execute virtual testing using VMs/QEMU to simulate target environments
- Conduct interactive testing using Jumpstarter to directly interact with the application
- Perform advanced SIL testing with virtualized and simulated hardware platforms (e.g. Corellium)
- Verify that all requirements are met in the actual runtime environment

NOTE: Using a simulated hardware platform like Corellium is not part of this lab!

Create a new release and merge the PR into the main branch to finalize the validation process:

- Deploy and validate the application on the target platform using Jumpstarter

== Next

Now that we've covered the fundamentals of the Red Hat Automotive Development Platform (RHADP), Jumpstarter, and the development workflow, we're ready to proceed with hands-on lab activities!
