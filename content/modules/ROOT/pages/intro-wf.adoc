= Development Workflow

The following workflows show how a developer writes automotive software, orchestrates, and runs virtual tests and HIL tests on a target automotive platform:

[#project_creation]
== Project creation

- Development begins in the Red Hat Developer Hub portal.
- The developer selects a software template to instantiate a new project.
- After providing initial setup information, a new project is created and all the supporting infrastructure (e.g. build pipelines) is provisioned using OpenShift GitOps.

[#application_development]
== Application development

- The developer uses the RH DevSpaces to write code and also runs the first test locally, within the Web IDE.

[#application_testing]
== Application testing

- The code is pushed to the source code repository (e.g. GitHub or a hosted GitLab instance).
- Pushing the code triggers the build pipeline(s).
- After a successful build, the resulting artefacts (rpm, container, OS image) are stored in a central repository (e.g. Red Hat Quay) or storage location (e.g. S3).
- Optional: The cloud infrastructure is used to perform more complex integration tests prior to SIL or HIL testing.

[#application_validation]
== Application validation

- Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing of the application using VMs / Qemu.
- Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing of the application with virtualised and simulated hardware (e.g. provided by Corellium).
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing by connecting the cloud-based development platform to “real” hardware.
