== What is Jumpstarter

https://jumpstarter.dev/[Jumpstarter] is an open-source project to enable *Hardware in the Loop* testing and development for Edge devices.

Embedded and Edge devices have been traditionally tested in a manual way with a human operator. This is not scalable, and unsuitable for CI/CD pipelines.

In a modern development cycle we want to know that our software changes work well into our device hardware. We need to test the onboarding process, the software stack, the hardware, the updates and the interaction between all of them.

With Jumpstarter it's possible to use software CI/CD pipelines like OpenShift Pipelines, GitHub CI, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc., as well as integrated development and scientific environments like Jupyter and Devspaces to interact with your physical hardware.

== How does Jumpstarter work

Jumpstarter provides a set of tools that enable you to build a consistent development environment for your hardware. Think of it as a Makefile for hardware automation.

These tools enable you to decouple your target hardware from the test runners, development machines, and CI/CD pipelines allowing you to use the same automation scripts, commands, and processes everywhere.

The core components of Jumpstarter are:

   * https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/main/introduction/clients.html[Clients] that allow you to interact with your hardware through a CLI tool or Python library.

   * https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/main/introduction/drivers.html[Drivers] that describe how to interact with your hardware interfaces.

   * https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/main/introduction/exporters.html[Exporters] that expose your deviceâ€™s hardware using the drivers.

   * A https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/main/introduction/service.html[Service] that helps you manage hardware access from anywhere.

Since Jumpstarter's core components are written in Python, it is possible to run them almost everywhere. This means that you can setup a test lab with low-cost exporters such as Raspberry Pis or mini PCs, while still using the same Linux-based CI systems you currently host in the cloud.

Jumpstarter is also able to seamlessly integrate into the existing ecosystem of Python testing tools such as pytest. You can also use the Jumpstarter CLI directly from shell scripts and Makefiles allowing you to write simple automation scripts easily.

In addition to testing, Jumpstarter can also act as a KVM allowing developers to remotely access hardware for ad-hoc development whether they are sitting at the next desk or on the other side of the globe.
