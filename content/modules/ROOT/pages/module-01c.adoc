Jumpstarter can be used in either a local-only or distributed environment depending on your hardware development needs.

==== Local-Only

When using Jumpstarter locally, you can easily develop drivers, write automated tests, and control your hardware directly from your development machine.

The local-only mode is useful when working with hardware on your desk that you have unlimited access to.

==== Distributed

When your project grows, Jumpstarter also can help you collaborate across teams, implement CI/CD pipelines, and automate common tasks such as firmware updates.

The distributed mode takes advantage of Kubernetes to support the management of multiple target devices directly from your existing cluster. This allows for seamless integration with many existing Cloud Native technologies such as Tekton, ArgoCD, and Prometheus.
