= Develop Automotive Software in a Dev Space
:sectnums:

In this module we will learn how to develop, build, and test a simple automotive application using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

The source repo contains a set of applications that demonstrate how typical automotive applications use SOME/IP communicate, these apps work both natively and in a container. For the purpose of this lab, we would be focusing on the `radio-service` application. This is a service that emulates a radio, regularly publishing information about the current track, station, and volume level. This service accepts requests to turn on/off, change channel, and adjust the volume over SOME/IP.

== Build, Test, and Publish a Simple Automotive Application

We can easily build, test, and publish our application using the integrated terminal in our Dev Space.

IMPORTANT: Placeholder image, insert image showing hamburger menu and opening terminal.

Open the integrated terminal by navigating to the menu, selecting `Terminal` and `New Terminal`.

TIP: You can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + ``` to quickly open the terminal.

IMPORTANT: placeholder image, show terminal open at bottom of the screen with prompt.

You should now see a terminal prompt at the bottom of the editor.

=== Build the Applications

In the terminal, run the following commands:

[,console]
----
$ cmake .
$ make
----

TIP: `cmake .` generates a `Makefile` from `CMakeLists.txt` in our current working directory (`.`), which contains high-level instructions on how to build the applications. Running `make` executes the low-level instructions in the `Makefile` to build the applications.

Check the content of our working directory by running the following command.

[,console]
----
$ ls
----

You should see the two executable files we've just built, including `radio-service` and `radio-client`.

=== Test the Applications

To test our `radio-service` application, we need to first start it as a background process.

[,console]
----
$ ./radio-service &
----

TIP: Adding `&` at the end of the command will execute it in the background. This frees up the terminal for us to run other commands in parallel.

You will see the `radio-service` periodically print its current status into the terminal, in lines like:

[,console]
---
RADIO: Playing song "Upper Echelon" by Travi$ Scott feat. 2 Chainz & T.I. (on Radio Los Santos) 50% volume
---

Next, we can start the `radio-client` in the foreground to interact the running `radio-service`.

[,console]
----
$ ./radio-client
----

Press `+` or `-` to adjust the volume, `<SPACE>` to switch stations, and `<ESC>` to pause or resume the radio. Notice the changes in the printed status messages in response to your requests.

When done with testing, press `q` to quit the client, and stop `radio-service` by running:

[,console]
----
$ pkill radio-service
----

=== Modify the Radio Service (Optional)

If you are confident with programing in C++, feel free to make some changes to the `radio-stations.cpp` source file. You can add songs or stations, and repeat the build test cycle.

   { "Radio Los Santos", SONGS(radio_los_santos) },
   { "Space 103.2", SONGS(space_103_2) },
   { "West Coast Classics", SONGS(west_cost_classics) },
 };
----

=== Publish Applications

Now that we've finished developing and testing our code, we can publish it to our code repository.

Run the following commands to commit, tag, and push the changes:

[,console]
----
$ git commit -a -m "first revision" --allow-empty
$ git tag v0.0.1
$ git push
$ git push --tags
----

Once the changes are pushed to the code repository, a *Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines* task is triggered to automatically build the application and bundle it into a container.

TIP: We're using a container as it's the best way to package an application and all of its dependencies into a single unit. This makes it simple to distribute to physical or virtual  hardware for testing.

To check the progress of the build, see {app_build_pipeline}

== Next Steps

While *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces* provides us with a consistent environment for developing, building, and testing our automotive applications, it's still necassary to test our code on virtual or physical hardware to ensure stability and compatibility.

In the next module we will build a *RHIVOS* image with our application embedded to prepare for end-to-end testing in both virtualized and physical hardware environments with *Jumpstarter*.
