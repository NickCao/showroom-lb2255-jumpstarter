= Testing and Validation

While Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a consistent environment for developing, building, and testing automotive applications, 
comprehensive validation requires testing on virtual or physical hardware to ensure stability, performance, and compatibility across target platforms.

In this activity, we will build a RHIVOS image with our application embedded, preparing it for end-to-end testing in both 
virtualized and physical hardware environments using Jumpstarter.

== Development testing pipeline

Create a pull request to merge your changes from the ⁠develop branch into the ⁠main branch. This action triggers an automated CI pipeline that:

- Builds a new container image containing your modified application
- Generates a new RHIVOS image with your application integrated
- Leverages Jumpstarter and the Qemu exporter to create a virtual machine image
- Executes a comprehensive test suite against the virtual machine image

This pipeline validates your application in a controlled virtualized environment before proceeding to physical hardware deployment.

== Release deployment pipeline

After successful testing, create a "release" by merging the ⁠develop branch into the ⁠main branch. This triggers the deployment pipeline that:

- Builds the production-ready RHIVOS image optimized for your specific hardware platform
- Uses Jumpstarter to flash the image directly to the physical hardware

NOTE: The release pipeline focuses on deployment rather than testing, assuming all validation has been completed in the development pipeline.

== Next

Now that we've completed the development workflow, we'll explore advanced Jumpstarter capabilities including:

- Writing custom test cases for your specific application requirements
- Manual hardware flashing procedures for development and troubleshooting
