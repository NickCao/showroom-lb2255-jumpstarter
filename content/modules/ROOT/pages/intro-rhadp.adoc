= Red Hat Automotive Development Platform

Red Hat Developer Hub creates the core of the Red Hat Automotive Development Platform (RHADP) that consolidates tools and workflows for software-defined vehicle development. 
It provides a centralised environment where development teams can access standardised tools, automated testing processes and pre-configured components. 
The platform streamlines common tasks through automation and ensures compliance with automotive safety standards, while allowing developers to use familiar Linux-based tools. 
Its cloud integration enables scalable testing and development, and supports rapid prototyping and deployment of automotive software components.

== Solution architecture

The RHADP leverages a comprehensive cloud-native ecosystem centered around Red Hat Developer Hub and Red Hat DevSpaces, 
providing developers with instant access to fully configured development environments. 

This enterprise-grade internal development platform (IDP), built on the open source Backstage project, comes pre-loaded with all necessary development tools, 
extensions, and configurations through a centralized dashboard. The standardized approach not only enables teams to begin working immediately without setup delays, 
but also streamlines development processes while maintaining proper security and governance across the enterprise, ensuring consistency across development teams 
and minimizing environment-related issues.

The diagram below provides an overview of the RHADP architecture:

== Virtual and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing

Virtual testing and Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing are key methods in modern automotive software development. Virtual testing allows developers to 
validate vehicle systems through simulation, eliminating the need for physical prototypes and reducing development costs and time. 

HIL testing takes this a step further by connecting actual vehicle hardware components, such as ECUs, sensors and actuators, to a simulation platform 
that creates a controlled test environment.
